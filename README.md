# endlessGuess

A game where you guess endlessly until you lose...

<p>
    The game rules are simple: you have to select how many numbers you
    want to choose between before beginning the game. Then, you will be
    guessing a number. If your guessed number is correct, you get a
    point and move on! If not, you will lose.
</p>
<p>
    There is singleplayer and multiplayer mode. In singleplayer mode,
    you will play by yourself. In multiplayer mode, you have to play
    with a friend on the same device. You have to select who goes first,
    and the person with the most amount of points wins!
</p>

**Good Luck and have fun!**
